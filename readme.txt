Make publishing of posts and pages on WordPress so much easier for you and your customers.

== Description ==

Two features that will help you to edit and save your posts and pages faster and with ease.

= FEATURE #1: Easily Open Recently Modified Posts and Pages =

Access recently modified posts, pages and custom post types from the admin bar. Also, find any post from an easily accessible alphabetical lookup.

* Use our new admin bar lookups to:
 - Find the five most recently modified posts, pages, or CPTs.
 - Find any post, page, or CPT within an alphabetical lookup list.
 - Access these lists on both front-end and back-end webpages.
 - See grouped posts by their status: All, Mine, Draft, Pending, Published, Scheduled, Private.
 - Hover over a post link to see the post slug, ID and parent name (if any).
 - Choose which Custom Post Types to list in the CPT lookup.

= FEATURE #2: Save As Draft or Update Your Post Directly From the Admin Bar =

When editing your post or page farther down the screen, easily access the Publish options such as Update or Save as Draft without the need to scroll back to the top.

*   Access Publish options from the top admin bar.
*   Update, Save As Draft or Preview Changes without scrolling to the top.
*   Keep working in the same place on the page.
